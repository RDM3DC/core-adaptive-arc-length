# Adaptive Arc Length

**ID:** `core-adaptive-arc-length`  
**Tier:** core  
**Score:** 50  
**Units:** WARN  
**Theory:** PASS-WITH-ASSUMPTIONS  

## Equation

$$
L_g(\gamma)=\int_0^1 \Omega(\gamma(t),t)\,|\dot\gamma(t)|\,dt
$$

## Description

Distances and penalties are measured in the adaptive geometry: path lengths scale with the local πₐ field.
